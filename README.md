# A todo application for GitHub is a software tool that allows users to manage their tasks and to-do lists directly within their GitHub repositories. This application is typically integrated into the user's GitHub account and enables them to create, track, and prioritize tasks and issues related to their projects.

# Users can create and assign tasks to themselves or other team members, set due dates, add labels and comments, and track the status of each task. The application provides a user-friendly interface that allows users to easily organize and manage their tasks in a centralized location, making it easier to stay on top of their project's progress and ensuring that nothing falls through the cracks.

# With a todo application for GitHub, users can streamline their workflow and improve collaboration with their team members. The application helps to increase productivity and efficiency by ensuring that everyone is on the same page, with a clear understanding of what needs to be done and when.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
